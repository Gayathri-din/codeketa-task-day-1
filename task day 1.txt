Q1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP1.1

It works on the textual format.	
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.	
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages. 
It compresses data by itself.	

HTTP2

It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
It uses HPACK for data compression.

Q2.Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address.

IP address:
           An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. 
           IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.
MAC address:
           A MAC address (media access control address) is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each device connected to the network. 
           Primarily specified as a unique identifier during device manufacturing, 
           the MAC address is often found on a device's network interface card (NIC).

HTTP methods:
           The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
           HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.
HTTP Methods:
GET
POST
PUT
HEAD
DELETE
PATCH
