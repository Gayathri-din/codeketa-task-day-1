Q1.Read about different between window, screen document in javacsript?


i)Document:

              =>It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
              =>It is loaded inside the window.
              =>It is the object of window property.
              =>All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
              =>We can access the document from a window using the window. document
              =>The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
              =>Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
syntax:

      document.propertyname;
example:

     document.title :  will return the title of the document



ii)Window Object:
              =>It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.  
              =>It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser. 
              =>It is the object of the browser.
              =>Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
              =>We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
              =>The window is part of BOM, not DOM.Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.

syntax:

window.propertyname;

example:

window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser



iii) screen:


               =>Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions . 
               =>It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc. 
               =>It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. 
               =>It can be written without window prefix.

Properties:
 
screen.width
screen.height
screen.availWidth
screen.availHeight
